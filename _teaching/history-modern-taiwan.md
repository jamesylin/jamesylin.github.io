This course covers the history of modern Taiwan from approximately 1600 to the present.  It aims to grapple with key issues of politics, society, and culture pertinent to Taiwan as well as contextualize Taiwanâ€™s history within larger, global historical frames.  How has Taiwan been shaped by its colonialism, peoples, and capitalism?  How have these forces affected key issues today such as identity, democracy, and cross-Strait relations?  Lecture, in-class discussion, and readings will address key issues such as migration, empire, ethnic identity, urban spaces, the Cold War, development, capitalism, memory, religion, labor, and gender.
