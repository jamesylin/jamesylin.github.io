I am a historian of modern Taiwan and Assistant Professor at the University of Washington Jackson School of International Studies. I earned my PhD in History at the University of California, Berkeley.

Broadly, I am interested in political economy, development, and capitalism. My current book project examines the history of agrarian development, beginning in Taiwan in the 1950s and ending with Taiwan's development missions to Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America during the Cold War.

I write for the public on issues of history, politics, and society in Taiwan and China. I have written an op-ed for *The Guardian*, advised Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, and been quoted or interviewed by *NPR, The New York Times, BBC News, Associated Press, Nikkei Asia, Al Jazeera, Quartz, VICE World News, Global News, Hyphen Magazine,* and other international media.
