I am a historian of modern Taiwan and [Assistant Professor at the University of Washington Jackson School of International Studies](https://jsis.washington.edu/people/james-lin/). I earned my PhD in History at the University of California, Berkeley.  At UW, I also help run the [University of Washington Taiwan Studies Program](https://jsis.washington.edu/taiwan/).

Broadly, I am interested in political economy, development, and capitalism, and their intersections with science and technology studies, environment, diplomacy, and food. My forthcoming book, [*In the Global Vanguard: Agrarian Development and the Making of Modern Taiwan*](/~jameslin/book) examines the history of agrarian development in Taiwan and in Taiwan's development missions to the Global South during the Cold War.

I write for the public on issues of history, politics, and society in Taiwan and China. I have [written articles for *The Guardian* and *Jacobin*](/~jameslin/commentary), advised [Last Week Tonight with John Oliver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y18-07g39g), and been quoted by *NPR, The New York Times, The New Yorker, BBC News, Associated Press, Nikkei Asia, Al Jazeera, Quartz, VICE World News, Global News,* among others.

My research has been supported by the Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation, the Society for Historians of American Foreign Relations, Fulbright, Taiwan National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan MOFA Fellowship, the Chiu Scholarly Exchange Program, the Wilson Center, among others.
